##Background and Overview
- An interactive perpetually moving digital painting
- The painting will have 3 interactive layers
- The painting will have geometric patterned background that will move left to right or change tile color 
- the middle ground will be biomorpic or cuvilear abstract shape that move in more randomized directions
- foreground paint splatter shapes will fade in and out 

##Functionality and MVPs
- When users clicks or utilizes a dial the moving painting will
- change direction: the background will move up, down, left or right at increasing or decreasing speed; the middleground shape will will increase/decrease in density, size, and speed; the foreground splatter will increase in speed of fade/ size. 
- users will be able to change the color scheme of any individual layer element

- Canvas
- Webpack for bundling JS files

##Timeline
- day 1: project skeleton
- day 2: implement shape rendering
- day 3: implement capability to change direction
- day 4: implement capability to change colors
- day 5: implement capability to change shapes

##Bonus
- users can increase the density of any one layer element
